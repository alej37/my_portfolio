        <p>Hello! My name is Alejandro Calzadilla,</p>
        <p>I am a Web Developer in Quebec City.
        I just recently completed Le Wagon Montreal 9 week bootcamp in web development(batch #482).
        In addition to my new programming passion, I am also a freelance Cellist who plays with several
        orchestras like the Quebec Symphony and Les Violons du Roy. I love playing video games (rocket league and COD),
        avid ping pong player and a cat trainer (yes, my cat can sit and high five!). I am currently looking for new
        opportunities to continue improving my programming skills.
